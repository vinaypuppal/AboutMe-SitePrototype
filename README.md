## About Me

I'm a self-taught web developer with an eye for design, UX and UI development and a strong desire to learn and create.I firmly believe in life long learning and I'm constantly exploring new ideas and technologies. A while ago i started learning HTML, CSS, Javascript and after hacking away for a while I realised I wanted to learn coding properly. Since then I read some books ( <a target="_blank" href="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/" title="http://www.htmlandcssbook.com/">HTML & CSS by Jon Duckett</a> and <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS" target="_blank" title="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">YDKJS series by Kyle Simpson</a> ), have taken courses with <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com" target="_blank" title="http://www.freecodecamp.com">FreeCodeCamp</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank" title="https://www.codecademy.com/" >Codecademy</a> and built the various projects listed here.
