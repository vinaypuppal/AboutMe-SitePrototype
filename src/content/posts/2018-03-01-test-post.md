## Offline Co-Learning Spaces
Physical spaces where you can come down to engage in self learning, peer-learning and collaboration.
These are dynamic learning environments where everyone learns at their own pace and compliments each other. We also organize weekly group activities like Open Source evenings, casual hackathons etc.
