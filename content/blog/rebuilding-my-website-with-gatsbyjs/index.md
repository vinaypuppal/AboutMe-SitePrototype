For the past couple of weeks, I have been rebuilding my personal website from scratch. In this article, I will tell you how I built this site using [GatsbyJs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and why I have choosen this static site generator.

### Background

For a bit of background, I originally build my old website in 2016 while I was doing [freecodecamp](https://freecodecamp.org/vinaypuppal) curriculum. It was built with just HTML, CSS and jQuery. At that time I want to built it in a minimal way so I did not use any CSS frameworks like bootstrap or semantic-ui. This way I could write CSS all by myself and also I can test my knowledge. Even though I built it as single page site (I mean I only used single index.html file) but did not use any client site routing libraries instead I used `hashes` to show and hide different screens.
